# Interpretable-ML-models

The Machine Learning models are known to be powerful at a predictive level but difficult to interpret. I propose the application of Model-Agnostic Methods to identify the most influential variables in modeling and the direction of their relationship with the predictions obtained. 

In this repository you will find a tutorial reproducible in R, on the application of interpretability models of machine Learning. The programmed code "Code_interpretability", the database used "data_tutorial.RData" and some outputs explained in "Tutorial_Interpretability_Methods", can be consulted and used freely by the GitHub community. 

I hope it's useful !
